A simple array of miner in computer craft

# Requirements
You will need multiple enderchests from the ender storage mod, 56 mining turtles (can be modified in the master.lua file (will be called startup on the master turtle)

This is still work in progress, it's very likely still full of bugs

Make sure all of the turtles have atleast a wireless modem and that the slaves have a pickaxe
The pocket computer will need an endem modem as it,s equipped peripheral
